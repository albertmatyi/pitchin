## Features
  * generate tones from A0 to C8
  * display and generate 14 types of chords based on the selected main note
  * play a selected tempo, either by specifying the name or the bpm, range 20-440
  * automatically detect the bpm by repeatedly pressing the AutoBPM(left selection key, at least 3 times)
  * fine grained volume control 
  * pretty nice graphics (= not ugly)

## Controls
  * **up, down** - select different menu items
  * **left, right** - modify values
  * **right selection key** - back, exit
  * **left selection key** - plays chord (TGS), activate autobpm feature (MS)
  * **center selection key** - play note (TGS), start/stop metronome (MS)
  * **keys 1-8 (TGS)** - play the scale based on the note selected
  * **\*,#** - control the volume. if they are held down the volume is in/decremented by smaller amounts, else (they are simply pressed) it is changed by 25%


**TGS** - tone generation screen
**MS** - metronome screen


### Notes:
The note graphic was stolen  from my brother's audiovisual association called ToneTroopers. All the other graphics are hand woven, washed and digitalized.


The application was written especially for the **Nokia 5130 Xpress music** phone (a B-day present for my brother :D), but it should run without any problems on any phone supporting MIDP2.0.
